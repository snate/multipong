# multipong

Multipong is a multiplayer game for smartphones that works over Wi-Fi Direct
ad-hoc networks.

Even if other Pong revisitations for Android devices already existed at the
start of our project, no one of the games we found was able to manage
multiplayer matches with more than two players.
