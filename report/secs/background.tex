\subsection{Wi-Fi Direct: Background}
Wi-Fi Direct standard enables devices to connect with each other, creating 
networks called \textit{groups}, without requiring a wireless access point. It
could be used for several purposes because devices communicate at typical Wi-Fi

speed \cite{bib:wifiP2pspec}, which varies on the 802.11 standard implemented,
as well as the particular features of the devices and the surroundings.
Moreover, Wi-Fi Direct enables devices from different manufactors to communicate.

Usually, a device that supports Wi-Fi Direct, in order to create or join a group,
start a discovery session in which it may find other unconnected Wi-Fi Direct 
devices or Group Owners. In the second case the device ask to join a group, in the 
first one it can start the formation of a group. During the creation of a group 
devices negotiate their roles, in order to find a devices that assumes the role of 
access point called Group Owner (hereafter \textit{GO}) and other devices, even 
ones that doesn't support Wi-Fi Direct, could connect to the GO. 

\subsection{Wi-Fi Direct in Android: Background}
Since its 4.0 version was released, Android has been supporting peer-to-peer 
(\textit{P2P} from now on) P2P Wi-Fi communication that is compliant with the 
Wi-Fi Direct standard\cite{bib:wifiP2pspec}. 
Hence, recent Android devices can form an ad-hoc network with a $1:n$ topology,
in which a Group Owner is connected to multiple P2P clients (hereafter \textit{NGO}s).

As stated in the standard, the GO is decided after a negotiation phase between
the devices; thus, the same hosts may create a P2P network with different GOs
from time to time.

Thanks to the possibility of using Wi-Fi Direct in Android enviroment, it is 
possible to create Android applications that execute on different devices and 
communicate using this standard, for example game or chat applications. 

The implementation of Wi-Fi Direct in Android presents some issues. First of all
Android doesn't allow to a device to join two diffent Wi-Fi Direct group, but 
the standard permit that. Another problem is that in Android devices must ask 
to the user the permission to join to a group, and that limit the possibility
of creating networks of devices using Wi-Fi Direct automatically.

\subsection{Casual games: Background}
Casual games are video games which have really simple gameplay and they are
thought to be targeted to mass audiace. In fact, casual game users, usually, are
older than other kind of gamers and more predominantly woman. That kind of video
games could be played by users with no special skills and not spending too much 
time.

Originally, casual games were played by users throught a web browser, but now 
are popular on game consoles and smartphones.

Nowadays the idea of casual gaming is mashed up with the idea of social networks,
allowing players to play on social network or in multi player mode.
