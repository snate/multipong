Since its 4.0 version was released, Android has been supporting peer-to-peer
(\textit{P2P} from now on) Wi-Fi communication that is compliant with the
Wi-Fi Direct standard\cite{bib:wifiP2pspec}.
Hence, recent Android devices can form an ad-hoc network with a $1:n$ topology,
in which a Group Owner (hereafter \textit{GO}) is connected to multiple P2P
clients (hereafter \textit{NGO}s).

As stated in standard, the GO is decided after a negotiation phase between the
devices; thus, the same hosts may create a P2P network with different GOs from
time to time, after re-establishing the network.
