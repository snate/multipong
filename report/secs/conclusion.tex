\section{Conclusion}
%%*************************************************************************
In this paper we have presented issues and possibile solution that we 
encounter developing a simple multiplayer game based on Wi-Fi Direct 
technology. The main problem that we met is that the connection between 
different peers with Wi-Fi direct is really cumbersome. This must be done 
using Android settings and very often it takes too much time. 

Another problem is manage the unreachability of the GO in a Wi-Fi Direct
network. At the current state of art the best solution, for us, is what we 
implemented, that is interrupt the current match, because of the 
impossibility to reconstruct the network in a short time and automatically.

A further issues that we noticed is that the Wi-Fi Direct connection 
between two different devices could be easily disturbed trying to connect 
to one of the two devices with another one. Most of the times, in that case
the only thing to do is to cancel the request of connection and restart the 
formation of the network.

On the other hand, if the network is created correctly and there are not 
some other devices that try to join the network, we find out that the game 
is enjoyable and the Wi-Fi Direct could be a quite good solution for 
multiplayer mobile games.
