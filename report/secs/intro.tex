\section{Introduction}
According to Newzoo, mobile games market is expanding so much that in 2019
it is predicted to reach almost half of all the global games
market\cite{bib:newzoo}. This fact leads us to think that it is worth studying
this emergent field, also because smartphones and tablets are nowadays
pervasive in everyday's life of people.

If you visit Google's Play Store, you might notice that most of the top
grossing games are online multiplayer games, with many of them requiring
real-time users interaction. Clearly, since pleasant online real-time gaming
was already hard to achieve within the context of \textit{wired} networks, now
it is even more difficult with \textit{wireless} networks and devices with
power saving issues.

Moreover, things get even tougher when it comes to ad-hoc networks and mobile
devices: most of the games you can find on Google's Play Store are indeed
multiplayer games that work with a remote server. Furthermore, the few mobile
games we were able to find for local networking are limited to two-players
matches. Hence, we are interested in finding out what would be the quality of
a simple Android application in an ad-hoc network with matches composed of
possibly more than two players.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: in section II we talk about
other work in this context and talks about ad-hoc networking support in Android;
in section III we describe how we developed the game; in Section IV we discuss
how we conducted the experiments; in Section V we show the results of our tests;
finally, Section VI wraps up this paper.
