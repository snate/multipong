\section{Introduction}
According to Newzoo, mobile games market is expanding so much that in 2019
it will reach almost the half of all the global games
market\cite{bib:newzoo}. This fact leads us to think that it is worth studying
this emergent field, also because smartphones and tablets are nowadays
pervasive in everyday's life of people.

If you visit Google's Play Store, you might notice that most of the top
grossing games are online multiplayer games, with many of them requiring
real-time users interaction. Clearly, since pleasant online real-time gaming
was already hard to achieve within the context of \textit{wired} networks, now
it is even more difficult with \textit{wireless} networks and devices with
power saving issues.
